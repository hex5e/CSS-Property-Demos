# CSS-Property-Demos
HTML pages that demonstrate how different CSS properties work
Each page is named after the property it demos

To get the most out of this repo
- Install VSCode or some IDE
- Get the 'Live Preview'* extension for VSCode (or equivalent if using some other IDE)
- Preview one of the docs, play around with the source code and see how the markup changes


* I suggest Live Preview because it's very responsive, you can change a line in the source code and immediately see how the markup is changed, no need to refresh the web browser
